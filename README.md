Your personalized trading dashboard for the morning coffee :-)

Live at: https://ricsiboard.com

## TODO

* Publish repo - review if all materials can be shared in history
* Get review
* Share buttons (FB/Twitter/etc. etc.)
* Fix filtering for params (fbclid should be filtered out from charts, etc.)
* Keywords for Google
* Validate that there are no , and | characters within the paramsTable fields

### Later maybe

* Feature - Rightclick -> Add trendlines somehow?
* Feature - Add chart with button (search tickers)
* Mobile - Params table is pretty much screwed up

	  .setLineStyle(0)

	order.setPrice(7000);

## To be tested later

* Donate button :-)

## For the review to discuss

* ; or not to ;
* Eliminate JQuery?
* Global state or local state - params enough hidden hm?
* More functional approach?
* Add minimal tests? Any lightweight framework recently?
